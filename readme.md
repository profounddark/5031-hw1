# Assignment

In class, we discussed three ways to compute the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence:

- Classic recursive
- Iterative
- Recursive with accumulators
- Constant
  Write a program in the language of your choice that implements Fibonacci in each of the first three techniques and counts the number of addition operations when called.

## Submission

Turn in your homework via Canvas and include the source code and raw output of your program. Fill out the following table and submit it as well:

Number of addition operations inâ€¦

|      | fib(n) | Classic Recursive | Iterative | Recursive w/ Accum |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| n=3  |        |                   |           |                    |
| n=10 |        |                   |           |                    |
| n=20 |        |                   |           |                    |
